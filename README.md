# Tobiloba Ayomide – Logic Behind My Portfolio

For a long time, I wanted to refine my portfolio and make it truly mine. I finally took the courage to start, and this is the story of how I rebuilt it.

## 1. Breaking It All Down

I started by cloning my ([old portfolio](https://hunkymanie.vercel.app)) and decided the first thing to do was break the big `App.tsx` into smaller, reusable components for each sections. I wanted each section to be easy to work on and update.

## 2. The Navbar

I began with the navbar. My goal was minimalism, so I ditched my old logo and went for a clean, glassmorphic look. The result is a simple, modern navbar that blends into the background and keeps the focus on the content.

## 3. The Loading Effect


Next, I wanted a little polish when the site loads. I added a loading screen that appears for a few seconds before the main site shows up. This gives a smooth first impression and a bit of personality.

![Project Loading Screen](./public/loading.png)

Here’s a simplified version of the JavaScript (React) code for the loading effect:

```js
// App.tsx (main loading logic)
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function App() {
   const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(true);

   useEffect(() => {
      // Set loading time (e.g., 2000 for 2s, 7000 for 7s)
      const timer = setTimeout(() => {
         setIsLoading(false);
      }, 2000);
      return () => clearTimeout(timer);
   }, []);

   return (
      <div>
         {isLoading && <LoadingScreen />}
         {/* ...rest of your app */}
      </div>
   );
}

// LoadingScreen.tsx (component)
import './LoadingScreen.css';

const LoadingScreen = () => (
   <div className="loading-screen">
      <div className="loading-content">
         <div className="loading-logo">
            <div className="loading-name">
               <span className="name-white">tobi</span>
               <span className="name-purple">loba</span>
            </div>
         </div>
         <div className="loading-bar">
            <div className="loading-progress"></div>
         </div>
      </div>
   </div>
);
```

The CSS animates the loading bar and centers the content. You can adjust the loading time in the `setTimeout` in `App.tsx`.

## 4. The Hero Section

For the hero, I wanted something more personal. I used ([Cartonize](https://www.cartoonize.net/avatar-maker/)) to create a cartoon avatar of myself and added it to the hero section. To make it more dynamic, I added a typing effect for my role.

![Hero Section](./public/herosection.png)

Here’s a snippet of the code I used for the typing effect:

```js
const roles = [
   'Frontend Developer',
   'Blockchain Developer',
   'Web3 Enthusiast'
];

useEffect(() => {
   const typingSpeed = isDeleting ? 50 : 100;
   const pauseTime = 2000;

   const timer = setTimeout(() => {
      const fullRole = roles[roleIndex];
      if (!isDeleting) {
         if (currentRole.length < fullRole.length) {
            setCurrentRole(fullRole.substring(0, currentRole.length + 1));
         } else {
            setTimeout(() => setIsDeleting(true), pauseTime);
         }
      } else {
         if (currentRole.length > 0) {
            setCurrentRole(fullRole.substring(0, currentRole.length - 1));
         } else {
            setIsDeleting(false);
            setRoleIndex((prev) => (prev + 1) % roles.length);
         }
      }
   }, typingSpeed);

   return () => clearTimeout(timer);
}, [currentRole, isDeleting, roleIndex]);
```

## 5. The Hero & About Section

After the hero, I wanted to give visitors a quick summary of who I am, so I added a short profile and my education details right on the page.

![About Page](./public/aboutpage.png)

For my technical skills, I wanted something more lively than a static list. I built an automatic scrolling carousel of all the tech logos I use. Here’s a simplified version of the JavaScript for the infinite scrolling effect:

```js
// Duplicate the skills array to create a seamless loop
const duplicatedSkills = [...skills, ...skills];

// In the JSX:
<div className="skills-carousel">
   <div className="skills-track">
      {duplicatedSkills.map((skill, index) => (
         <div key={index} className="skill-card">
            <img src={skill.icon} alt={skill.name} />
            <span>{skill.name}</span>
         </div>
      ))}
   </div>
</div>
```

The CSS handles the animation, making the logos scroll smoothly across the screen.

## 6. Projects Section & Details

For my projects, I wanted something interactive and visually appealing. I used a card layout for each project, and just like my skills section, the projects also scroll automatically in a carousel. When you hover on a card, it reveals the category of the project—whether it’s SaaS, eCommerce, FinTech, or something else.

![Project Section](./public/projectsection.png)

At the bottom, I added a “View all projects” button that leads to a dedicated page ([see it live](https://tobicode.netlify.app/projects)) showing every projects.

Then I added a “View Project” button on each projects. Clicking it takes you to a single project details page.

![Each Project Section](./public/projectpage.png)

Instead of creating a separate page for every project, I made a single, styled Project Details page. I store all my project info in a single file, `projectsData.ts`, and use the project’s ID to fetch the right data.

#### Here’s a simplified version of how I store the data:

```ts
// src/data/projectsData.ts
export interface Project {
   id: number;
   title: string;
   category: string;
   description: string;
   image: string;
   technologies: string[];
   liveUrl: string;
   githubUrl: string;
}

export const projectsData: Project[] = [
   {
      id: 1,
      title: 'myRESUMEnow',
      category: 'SaaS',
      description: 'A resume builder with real-time preview and PDF export.',
      image: '/assets/myRESUMEnow.png',
      technologies: ['React', 'TypeScript', 'Firebase'],
      liveUrl: 'https://my-resume-now.vercel.app',
      githubUrl: 'https://github.com/tobilobaayomide/myRESUMEnow'
   },
   // ...more projects
];

// Helper to get a project by ID
export const getProjectById = (id: number): Project | undefined =>
   projectsData.find(project => project.id === id);
```

#### And here’s how the Project Details page fetches the data:

```tsx
// src/pages/ProjectDetailsPage.tsx
import { useParams } from 'react-router-dom';
import { getProjectById } from '../data/projectsData';

const ProjectDetailsPage = () => {
   const { id } = useParams();
   const project = getProjectById(Number(id));

   if (!project) return <div>Project not found.</div>;

   return (
      <div>
         <h1>{project.title}</h1>
         <img src={project.image} alt={project.title} />
         <p>{project.description}</p>
         {/* ...other details */}
      </div>
   );
};

export default ProjectDetailsPage;
```

This way, adding a new project is as simple as updating one file, and the details page just works!

## 7. The Footer & Personal Touches

To wrap things up, I gave the footer a more standard and polished look. I integrated quick links for easy navigation, added my contact info, and made sure it fits the overall style of the site.

![Footer](./public/footer.png)

This project was personal to me, so I went the extra mile: I used the cartoon avatar I created as my favicon, making the branding feel truly mine.
